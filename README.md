# Zhihu-Daily-on-Web
This is the source code for website version "Zhihu Daily"
You can access the website by this link http://zhihudl.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Zhihu is a Chinese "Quora" like website, and "Zhihu Daily" is a mobile app which delivers everyday collection of Zhihu post.
Unfortunately, Zhihu Offcial seems not wanting to make a Web version of "Zhihu Daily", which is definitely not good news for zhihu lovers (like me) who want to have an alternative.

The idea of this project is realizing the function of "Zhihu Daily" on a webpage so you can enjoy the contents anytime anywhere.
Also, if want to accessing the "Zhihu Daily" collection of a certain (past) day, you can do it by a simple click, which is not supported by the official mobile app!
